            <b>Do I need to be of a certain nationality in order to buy a title pack?</b>
            <p>
                No. In fact, for complicated legal reasons, we prefer people who have no recognized nationality whatsoever. 
                Our title packs are available to all nationalities and ages (unless you're a baby; babies are silly).
            </p>
            <br>
            <b>Will people infer that I am a baby if I do not have a Fuckmeistership because Fuckmeisterships are so cool that anyone who can have one decides to get one immediately?</b>
            <p>
                While we at Unestablished Titles hope to provide services to speakers of all languages, we are still working on our "baby talk" translator.
                At the moment, we do not understand this question.
                We'll get back to you with an answer as soon as we can! 
            </p>
            <br>
            <b>Am I allowed to be a Fuckmeister if I'm under the legal age of consent to sex?</b>
            <p>
                Just because you can't <em>fuck</em> doesn't mean you can't fuck. If you're old enough to fuck up your homework, you're old enough to be a Fuckmeister. Unless you're a baby of course.
            </p>
            <br>
            <b>Can I refer to myself as a Fuckmaestro, Fuckmaestra or Fuckmeister?</b>
            <p>
                Yes, our title packs are based on a historic Suburbish land ownership custom where landowners have been long referred to as "Fuckmeistros", the Suburbish term for "One Real Cool Guy", with the female equivalent being "Fuckmaestra" and the gender-neutral equivalent being "Fuckmeister."
                Most jurisdictions will allow you to update your title when you choose to do so.
            </p>
            <p>
                If they don't, implement revolutionary praxis.
            </p>
            <br>
            <b>I'm genderfluid. Will my title permit me to refer to myself as a Fuckmaestro <em>and</em> a Fuckmeistra <em>and</em> a Fuckmeister?</b>
            <p>
                Yes -- just remember to request the presence of your desired combination of those titles on your Title Request Message. We can put one of them on, two of them on, or all three on!
            </p>
            <br>
            <b>Can I buy the title pack for someone else?</b>
            <p>
                Yes - all we require is their name. 
                For this purpose, we also provide a bonus option of the title "Fuckprince" which is the historic term for "Fuckboy".
                Bequeathing this special title unto someone has been done ritualistically for millions of years in a process known as the "sweet diss."
            </p>
            <br>
            <b>Can I refer to myself as a Fuckprince?</b>
            <p>
                Most jurisdictions will allow you to update your title when you choose to do so. Nevertheless, I will judge you for choosing to do so.
            </p>
            <br>
            <b>Can I be a Fuckprincess?</b>
            <p>
                We at Unestablished Titles seek to respect the old Suburbish customs treating <em>Fuckprince</em> as a gender neutral title that may be applied to anyone and everyone. Just as a woman in the modern era can be a fuckboy, so too may they be a Fuckprince.
            </p>
            <b>Do you personally take on the title of Fuckmeister?</b>
            <p>
                I am a virgin, actually, and have thus not taken on the title of Fuckmeister. 
                I feel it would be a disingenuous representation of my sexuality.
            </p>
            <p>
                I guide others to a treasure I cannot possess.
                If you take issue with this state of affairs, feel free to reach out to Unestablished Titles for further discussion.

            <b>Can I choose my plot number?</b>
            <p>
                Plots are numbered consecutively and assigned automatically; unfortunately we are unable to guarantee or assign a specific plot number. 
                This ensures that your friends who ordered a Fuckmeistership before you did can prove it with their lower plot number, demonstrating unequivocally that they are cooler than you.
            </p>
            <p>
                You are, however, allowed to name your plot as you see fit as long as the name has not already been taken. Sorry folks, someone already called dibs on <em>Kitchen Island</em>.
                These names may be optionally reflected in your digital certificate.
            </p>
            <br>
            <b>How will my digital certificate be sent to me?</b>
            <p>
                Your personalized digital certificate will be emailed to you when I get around to it, which shouldn't take too long. 
                It's not like sending an e-mail is that hard. 
                You can print this out and use it as you wish! 
            </p>
            <br>
            <b>Where are the plots?</b>
            <p>
                The plots are at my grandma's house -- mostly in the kitchen and eating areas. 
                There's also tile in the bathroom so I guess you might get a plot in there.
            </p>
            <br>
            <b>Can you tell me whether my plot is in your bathroom or not?</b>
            <p>
                Look, this is supposed to be a funny thing. Please don't make it weird.
            </p>
            <br>
            <b>Can I build on my plot?</b>
            <p>
                The laws of physics technically permit this but please don't I live here.
            </p>
            <br>
            <b>Why don't you have a meaningless countdown timer that resets whenever you clear your browser like some other title distributors?</b>
            <p>
                The countdown timer you are likely referencing uses JavaScript. I refuse to use JavaScript. This website is fully static.
            </p>
            <br>
            <b>Can I get a refund on my order?</b>
            <p>
                The intention of these packs is to provide a fun, novelty product for those who want to purchase something a little different for themselves, their friends or their family so we have no refund policy.
