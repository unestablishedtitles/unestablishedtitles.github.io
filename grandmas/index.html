            <h1>Fuckmeistro & Fuckmeistra Title Packs</h1>
            <p>
                Purchase a personal Fuckmeistroship or Fuckmeistraship Title Pack with dedicated land in my grandma's house.*
            </p>
            <p>
                Our Title Packs are based on a historic Suburbish land ownership custom, where landowners have been long referred to as whatever they darn well please. 
                If you deign to be referred to as a Fuckmeistro or a Fuckmeistra, that is entirely your business.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>
                    *This is a purchase for a personal dedication for a legally meaningless claim to one tile of land in my grandma's house. 
                    You may choose to title yourself with the title of Fuckmeistro, Fuckmeistra, Fuckmeister and any combination/permutation therein.
                </em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Every Fuckmeistroship or Fuckmeistraship title pack contributes to the happiness of animals in my grandma's house. 
                As the intention is for the land to be kept in its suburbanized state, we ask that all interested parties do bear this in mind.
            </p>

            <h1>Each Pack Contains:</h1>
            <p>
                One square tile of dedicated land on a private estate and a theoretically printable certificate with a crest, making it the perfect gift for anyone, anywhere.
            </p>
            <p>
                The intention of these packs is to provide a fun, novelty product for those who want to purchase something a little different for themselves, friends and family, all while simultaneously making me laugh maniacally.
            </p>
            <p>
                While many love their Fuckmeistro and Fuckmeistra title packs, we do understand that it may not be for everyone and so we have no refund policy. If you would like to take advantage of our refund policy, please seek out a service that involves exchanging money.

            <p>
                Unestablished Titles is committed to the preservation and protection of the residential areas of my grandma's house. 
                As part of our concerted efforts, Unestablished Titles has pledged to keep the entire residential area free from any other uses except for whatever my grandparents are cool with, thereby protecting the biodiversity of the flora and fauna of the area. We have further pledged to protect the land from being disturbed by sporting (excepting our pinball, foosball, and other tabletop games), driving or other similar activities. 
                There will be no baseball in the house.
            </p>
            <b>Unestablished Titles are committed to being mildly entertained by every order.</b>

                    They were right! 
                    I used a printer and now I have a real physical certificate I can hold in my hand! 
                    With almost no effort, I took an idea and conjured into the physical world!
